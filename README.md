# go-sort
A collection of algorithms written in go as I learn
more about Golang!

# Purpose
Perhaps one day this might be used by everyone learning algorithms
to use as a solution guide in case they find it hard to understand some
things. In addition it's a great way to just revise the stuff.

# How to run benchmarks and tests
You should be able to run
```
go test -v -bench=.
```
